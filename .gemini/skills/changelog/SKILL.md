# Changelog Skill

## When to Use
- After completing a sprint or shipping a feature
- Before tagging a release or pushing to main
- When the user asks "what changed?" or "update the changelog"

## Reference
[Keep a Changelog v1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)

## Instructions

### 1. Locate or Create CHANGELOG.md
- Check project root for `CHANGELOG.md`
- If missing, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
```

### 2. Gather Changes
Scan recent work using:
- `git log --oneline` since last tagged version
- `tasks/todo.md` completed items
- User description of what was shipped

### 3. Categorize Changes
Every change goes into exactly one category:

| Category | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Added** | New features, new files, new capabilities |
| **Changed** | Modifications to existing functionality |
| **Deprecated** | Features that will be removed in future versions |
| **Removed** | Features that were removed |
| **Fixed** | Bug fixes |
| **Security** | Vulnerability patches |

### 4. Write Entry
```markdown
## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- Brief description of what was added

### Changed
- Brief description of what changed

### Fixed
- Brief description of what was fixed
```

### 5. Rules
- Most recent version at the top
- Always include the date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- One line per change, starting with a verb
- Group related changes under the same category
- Keep an `[Unreleased]` section at the top for ongoing work
- Never delete old entries

## Quality Gates
- Every entry has a date
- No empty categories (remove the heading if nothing to list)
- Entries are human-readable (not git commit hashes)
